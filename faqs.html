      <p><strong>What about my children, at what age should they first see a dentist?</strong></p>

      <p>As a general rule, your child should be seen at or before the age of three. Early visits provide us with the opportunity to spot and prevent oral/dental problems. This allows your child’s first experience with the dentist to be positive and non-threatening. Of course, special concerns can be seen at any time.</p>

      <a name="q16"></a>
      <p><strong>Is it bad if my gums bleed after I brush my teeth?</strong></p>

      <p>Your bleeding gums can be caused by several things, including improper brushing, plaque and/or tarter build-up below the gum line or infection due to gingivitis or periodontal disease. If you continue to experience this problem, please contact our office to set up an evaluation appointment.</p>

      <p><strong>My breath has a terrible odor, but I brush every day. Is it just me, or is there something you can do to help?</strong></p>

      <p>You are not alone. Halitosis, or bad breath, is a problem millions of people struggle with despite daily brushing. Here is a checklist of procedures to help you eliminate the problem: twice daily brushing, daily flossing and tongue cleaning, regular professional cleanings and careful cleaning of any dentures or removable dental appliances. However, if you are already doing these things and the problem persists, we can offer several solutions. Please come see us and find out how we can help with this embarrassing situation.</p>

      <a name="q19"></a>
      <p><strong>Do I really have to floss every day? What’s the big deal?</strong></p>

      <p>Flossing may feel like a step in the morning or evening that isnt necessary, but regular flossing is truly critical for your overall oral health. It loosens food particles in the tight spaces your toothbrush cant reach and it exercises your gum tissues. This is necessary to avoid gum disease. So, just think of daily flossing as a necessary finishing touch.</p>
